        <p>Hello! I am a second bachelor's student at CSU majoring in Computer Science. I got my first bachelor's from CU in Geology. My goal with this class and my CS degree is to further my capabilities with Python and eventually work my way towards becoming a full-stack developer. My biggest aspiration outside of doing well in my classes is to work my way towards building a simple web browser-based game. Cookie Clicker was a game I enjoyed in the past and I would love to create something akin, but much simpler.</p>
